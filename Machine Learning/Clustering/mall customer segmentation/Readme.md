# Mall Customer Segmentation Project #

## Project Overview: Mall Customer Segmentation

The "Mall Customer Segmentation" project focuses on clustering analysis of customer data from a shopping mall to identify distinct customer segments based on their demographic attributes and characteristics. By leveraging machine learning clustering algorithms, the project aims to provide insights into customer preferences, shopping behaviors, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Objective:

The primary objective is to perform clustering analysis on customer data from the shopping mall to segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographic attributes, including sex, marital status, age, education, income, occupation, and settlement size. By identifying customer segments, the project aims to enable personalized marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize business strategies within the mall environment.

## Dataset:
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on mall customers, including the following features:

- ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Sex: Gender of the customer (e.g., male, female).
- Marital Status: Marital status of the customer (e.g., single, married, divorced).
- Age: Age of the customer.
- Education: Education level of the customer (e.g., high school, college, graduate).
- Income: Annual income of the customer.
- Occupation: Occupation of the customer.
- Settlement Size: Size of the settlement where the customer resides (e.g., rural, urban, suburban).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Data Summary: Initial exploration of the dataset provides insights into its size, structure, and feature distributions.

* Feature Distributions: Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are used to analyze the distributions and relationships of numerical and categorical features.

## Methodology:

The project employs machine learning clustering algorithms such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographic attributes and characteristics. The choice of clustering algorithm depends on the characteristics of the dataset and the desired granularity of segmentation.

## Key Steps:

* Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for clustering analysis.

* Clustering Analysis: Multiple clustering algorithms are applied to the preprocessed data to identify meaningful customer segments based on similarities in their demographic attributes.

* Business Insights: Insights derived from clustering analysis are used to inform marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement initiatives tailored to different customer segments.

## Future Improvements:
- Integration of additional data sources such as customer behavior within the mall and purchase history to enhance clustering accuracy and granularity.
- Development of personalized marketing campaigns and customer loyalty programs based on insights derived from customer segmentation analysis.


## Dependencies:

* Python 3.12.0
* pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
* scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
* matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
