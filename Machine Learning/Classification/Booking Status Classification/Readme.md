# Booking Status Classification #

## Project Overview: Booking Status Classification

The "Booking Status Classification" project focuses on predicting the booking status of hotel reservations based on various factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to assist hotel management in optimizing reservation processes, improving customer service, and maximizing revenue.

## Project Objective:

The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying hotel booking statuses into categories such as confirmed, canceled. By analyzing features such as booking date, lead time, customer demographics, and reservation details, the model aims to provide insights into booking patterns and factors influencing reservation outcomes.

## Dataset:

The project utilizes a dataset containing information on hotel reservations, including booking dates, lead times, customer details, room types, reservation status, and additional booking attributes. The dataset enables analysis of historical booking data to identify patterns and trends in reservation behavior.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Data Summary: Initial exploration of the dataset provides insights into its size, structure, and feature distributions. Summary statistics and visualizations help identify trends, outliers, and potential patterns in booking data.

* Feature Distributions: Histograms, box plots, and bar charts are used to analyze the distributions of numerical and categorical features, revealing insights into booking trends and customer preferences.

* Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrices and heatmaps uncover relationships between features and booking outcomes, identifying key predictors and potential factors influencing reservation status.

* Feature Importance: Techniques like feature importance scores guide feature selection and model building, highlighting factors that significantly impact booking statuses.

## Methodology:
The project employs machine learning classification algorithms to predict booking statuses based on reservation attributes. Various algorithms such as logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests are explored to identify the most effective model for the task.

## Key Steps:

* Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

* Feature Selection and Engineering: Relevant features are selected, and new features may be engineered to improve model performance and capture meaningful patterns in the data.

* Model Training and Evaluation: Multiple classification models are trained using preprocessed data, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

* Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the selected models are fine-tuned using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance and generalization.

## Future Improvements:

- Use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning models, to enhance model performance.
- Integration of additional features such as customer reviews, promotional offers, and external factors (e.g., weather, holidays) to enhance prediction accuracy and capture complex booking dynamics.
- Implementation of real-time monitoring and feedback mechanisms to adapt the model to changing booking patterns and customer preferences.
- Development of a user-friendly interface or dashboard for hotel staff to interact with the classification model and visualize booking insights.
