# Project Overview: Real Estate Price Prediction System
The "Real Estate Price Prediction System" project aims to create an effective machine learning model for predicting property prices in a specified region. By analyzing historical sales data and property attributes, the system provides valuable insights to real estate investors, agents, and homebuyers, aiding in informed decision-making and market analysis.

## Project Objective:

Our primary objective is to create a predictive model capable of estimating property prices based on various factors such as status, number of bedrooms (bed), number of bathrooms (bath), lot size in acres (acre_lot), city, state, zip code, house size, previous sold date (prev_sold_date), and sale price (price). The system aims to empower users with accurate price estimates, facilitating negotiations, investment strategies, and property valuation.

## Dataset:

The project leverages a comprehensive dataset comprising **1.4 Million** historical sales records, property details, and neighborhood information from diverse regions. Key features include the status of the property, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, location details (city, state, zip code), house size, previous sold date, and sale price.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Data Overview: Initial exploration of the dataset provides insights into its structure, size, and distribution of features. Summary statistics and visualizations help identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

* Feature Distributions: Through histograms, box plots, bar plots ,and scatter plots, we examine the distributions and relationships of numerical and categorical features such as property size, location, and sale prices.

* Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrices and heatmaps reveal relationships between features and property prices, enabling the identification of significant predictors.

* Feature Importance: Techniques like feature importance scores guide feature selection and engineering, highlighting influential factors in predicting property prices.

## Methodology:
The project employs machine learning regression algorithms to develop predictive models for property price estimation. Various techniques such as multiple linear regression, Lasso regression, ridge regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting (XGBoost) are explored to determine the most effective model for the task.

## Key Steps:

* Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

* Feature Selection and Engineering: Relevant features are selected and new features may be derived to enhance model performance and capture meaningful patterns in the data.

* Model Training and Evaluation: Multiple regression models are trained using preprocessed data, and their performance is assessed using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared.

* Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the selected models are optimized using techniques like grid search to improve model accuracy and generalization.

## Future Improvements:

- Implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms such as neural networks with larger records to enhance model performance.
- Integration of additional data sources such as economic indicators, transportation access, and environmental factors to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.
- Implementation of advanced modeling techniques like time-series analysis or geospatial modeling to capture temporal and spatial dependencies in property prices.
- Development of a user-friendly interface or application for seamless interaction with the real estate price prediction system.

## Dependencies:

* Python 3.12.0
* pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
* scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
* matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
