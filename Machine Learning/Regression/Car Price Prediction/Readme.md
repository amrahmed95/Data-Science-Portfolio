# Car Price Prediction #

The "Car Price Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the price of cars based on various features and attributes. By leveraging historical data on car specifications and market prices, the project seeks to assist users in estimating the fair market value of a car given its characteristics.

# Objective:

The primary objective of the project is to build a predictive model that can help individuals, dealerships, and automotive industry stakeholders determine the appropriate selling price for a car. By analyzing factors such as make, model, year of manufacture, engine type, and additional features, the model aims to provide reliable price estimates.

# Dataset:

The project utilizes a dataset containing information on a wide range of cars, including their specifications, features, and corresponding prices. The dataset encompasses data points such as car make, model, year, engine type, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes.

# Methodology:

The project employs machine learning techniques to train and evaluate predictive models capable of estimating car prices. Various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, Support Vector Machine (SVR) and KNN are explored and compared to identify the most effective model for the task.

# Key Steps:

* Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as Data Cleaning, handling missing values, Standardization of key values in the dataset ,encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): inludes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and relationships between variables. This helps in identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.

* Feature Selection and Engineering: Relevant features are selected, and new features may be engineered to improve model performance and capture meaningful patterns in the data.

* Model Training and Evaluation: Several regression models are trained using the preprocessed data, and their performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared.

* Future Improvements:
Future enhancements to the project may include:

Integration of additional data sources to enrich the feature set and improve prediction accuracy.
Implementation of advanced modeling techniques such as neural networks or ensemble methods for more robust predictions.
Model Deployment and Integration: The project can be deployed as a web application or as an API allowing users to input car specifications and receive accurate price predictions
Development of a user-friendly interface or application for seamless interaction with the predictive model.
