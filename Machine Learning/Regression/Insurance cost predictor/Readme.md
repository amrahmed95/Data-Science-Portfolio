# Insurance Cost Prediction #

## Project Overview: Insurance Cost Estimator

The "Insurance Cost Estimator" project endeavors to create a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting insurance costs for individuals based on diverse demographic and health-related factors. By leveraging historical data on insurance premiums and individual attributes, the project aims to offer insurance companies and individuals a reliable tool to estimate the expected cost of insurance coverage.

## Project Objective:

Our primary aim is to develop a predictive model that empowers insurance companies and individuals alike to anticipate insurance premiums based on crucial factors including age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), smoking status, geographic region in USA, and other pertinent variables. Through accurate predictions, we seek to facilitate informed decision-making and risk assessment in the insurance domain.

## Dataset:

We utilize a comprehensive dataset of **1 Million Records** containing information on insurance premiums charged to individuals alongside their demographic and health-related attributes. This dataset encompasses key data points such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, region, and corresponding insurance charges.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Data Overview: We commence our analysis by gaining insights into the dataset's structure, size, and salient features. Summary statistics and visualizations aid in discerning patterns, trends, and outliers.

* Feature Distributions: Through histograms, box plots, and density plots, we explore the distributions of numerical features like age, BMI, and insurance charges, while categorical variables such as gender and smoking status are scrutinized using bar charts to understand their prevalence as well as the plots combining these two variables.

* Correlation Analysis: Utilizing correlation matrices and heatmaps, we probe the relationships between numerical features and insurance charges to unveil potential predictors of insurance costs.


## Methodology:

Our project harnesses machine learning regression techniques to train and evaluate predictive models capable of estimating insurance costs. We explore various regression algorithms, including linear regression, Lasso regression, SGD regression ,decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting (XGBoost), to identify the most effective model for the task.

## Key Steps:

* Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

* Feature Selection and Engineering: Relevant features are selected, and new features may be engineered to enhance model performance and capture meaningful data patterns.

* Model Training and Evaluation: Several regression models are trained using preprocessed data, with their performance evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.


## Future Improvements:

- Integration of additional data sources such as medical history and lifestyle factors to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Development of a user-friendly interface or application for seamless interaction with the insurance cost estimator model.
